# APB Account Donation TOS
Welcome to the Account Donation TOS for APB.

By donating an account, you agree to these terms:
1) If you donate an account, it's required to at least be unbanned from LabyMod's voice chat. This is mainly just so I can actually USE the bots.
2) If you donate an account such as an SFA or FA account, it's details may be changed for clarity or a banned name. (eg. ilovesex69 -> ilovefish69 because the first name was bannable on some servers)
3) If you donate one account instead of the other on accident, you can contact me at BowserLover#0001.

# Examples
NFA/SFA Account Format: email@yourprovi.der:password
FA Account Format: email@yourprovi.der:password:sq1:sq2:sq3
Legacy Account Format: username:password
