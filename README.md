# APB Account Donation TOS
Welcome to the Account Donation TOS for APB.

By donating an account, you agree to these terms:
1) If you donate an account, it's required to at least be unbanned from LabyMod's voice chat. This is mainly just so I can actually USE the bots.
2) If you donate an account such as an SFA or FA account, it's details may be changed for clarity or a banned name. (eg. ilovesex69 -> ilovefish69 because the first name was bannable on some servers)
3) If you donate one account instead of the other on accident, you can contact me at BowserLover#0001.

# Examples
1) NFA/SFA Account Format: email@yourprovi.der:password
2) FA Account Format: email@yourprovi.der:password:sq1:sq2:sq3
3) Legacy Account Format: username:password

# Other Examples
1) funkyfish1@gmail.com:iLOVEfish69
2) fishlove69@outlook.com:fishlover69420:i:love:fish
3) fishyfishy4:fish123456
